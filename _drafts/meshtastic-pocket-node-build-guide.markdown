- affiliate link to rakwireless to buy rak4631
- affiliate link to aliexpress to buy 2000mAh battery
- link to original 3d print object
- link to download 3d object file from blog in case page gets nuked
- photos of 3d print pieces before and after assembling
- photo of battery and board next to 3d printed pieces
- credit https://www.printables.com/@pdxlocs for the original design

- buy rak4631
- attach antennas before powering on
- plug into usb
- double press power button to put into dfu mode
- usb drive called RAK4631 should show up
- download meshtastic .uf2 firmware file and drag it into usb drive
- rak will reboot after flashing and pc might complain about unsafe removal, this is fine
- set lora region, device name and change bluetooth pin
- slot into 3d printed frame
- slide 3d printed pieces together
- done!

- further thoughts, modify 3d case for sma antenna?
- have great results with stock rak antenna though
- adjust depth of case to allow for 4000mAh battery, but should get a good week or two from 2000mAh

- mention previous post recommending heltec board, but state my opinion has changed, get a rak and 3d print this case
- the heltec board might have a quick clip together enclosure and no 3d printing needed, but the stock antenna is garbage
